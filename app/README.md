Cardiovascular Disease Predictor
A Streamlit-based web application that predicts the risk of cardiovascular disease using a tuned XGBoost model. Built with Python, this project includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation, leveraging datasets like cardio_train.csv. Explore the interactive interface to assess patient risk based on health metrics. Ideal for healthcare enthusiasts and data science learners!

Features
Predicts cardiovascular disease risk with a tuned XGBoost model.
Interactive Streamlit UI for user input and results.
Handles preprocessing and feature engineering automatically.

Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
Run the Streamlit app:

streamlit run app/appfiles/app.py

Enter patient details in the interface.
Click "Predict Health Risk" to see the result.
